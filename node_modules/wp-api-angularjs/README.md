## Authentication

This library only supports basic auth. OAuth1 not being suitable for JS clients (it would mean exposing key and password out of the open)

### Basic auth

Basic auth is only secured to use if used during the app run time and used with a secured connection to your Blog (via SSL).

#### During run time

Make sure your WP-API runs with an SSL certificate (https) otherwise this will expose your credentials at every request.

Display a form for users to connect and use the following code to register credentials:

```
.controller(function(WpApi){
    WpApi.setBasicCredentials(<login>, <password>);
});
```

#### During configuration

You can also set basic credentials during the configuration but use this should only be used for testing as it embed credentials in the application code.

```
.config(function(WpApiProvider){
    WpApiProvider.setBasicCredentials(<login>, <password>);
});
```
